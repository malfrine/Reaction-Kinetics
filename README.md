# Reaction Kinetics

## Overview
In this experiment, a 0.637 L continuously stirred tank reactor was used to react ethyl acetate and sodium hydroxide. The experimental objectives were to determine the residence time distribution function using the pulse input technique to determine the mixing character and model the conversion of the reactor. The raw data and data analysis script can be found in this respository.

## Scripts
"RxnDataRaw.mat" contains the raw data from experimentation

"analysis.m" provides the data analysis that was performed to comple the project objectives

"homer.m" calculates the numerical integral for a vector using Simpson's Rule.
