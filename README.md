# Reaction Kinetics

## Overview
In this experiment, a 0.637 L continuously stirred tank reactor was used to react ethyl acetate and sodium hydroxide. The experimental objectives were to determine the residence time distribution function using the pulse input technique to determine the mixing character and model the conversion of the reactor. The experimental conversion was determined by monitoring the conductivity of the solution during the reaction. The experimental conversion was obtained as a function of temperature and flow rate and compared to the perfectly mixed model, segregation model and maximum mixedness model. The raw data and data analysis script can be found in this respository.

## Scripts
"RxnDataRaw.mat" contains the raw data from experimentation

"analysis.m" provides the data analysis that was performed to comple the project objectives

"homer.m" calculates the numerical integral for a vector using Simpson's Rule.
